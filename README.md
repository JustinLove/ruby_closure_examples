The first version of the talk had several examples that didn't make the cut, and with refactoring the greater part are longer used.

The examples were originally developed under 1.8.7; as of last check, they all run under 1.9.1.  My environment is OS X using MacPorts; in particular, this environment installs 1.8 as 'ruby' and 1.9 as 'ruby1.9'.

## Generating Output

run rake; it will create .txt files with interleaved input/output, using irb and rspec.
